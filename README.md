# Recreator-3D-recreator-MK5-custom-firmware
i made custom firmware for my recreator MK5 and am still improving it, both compiled files and uncompiled will be available in different branched
# READY TO USE FIRMWARE
install the ready to use firmware as a zip, and extract it, coppy JUST the .bin file to your MSD(<=32gb) card after reformating it to FAT32, plug it into your machine while it is off, 
then turn it on and wait for the machine to boot (15-30 seconds) 
DO NOT REMOVE POWER BEFORE IT BOOTS!!!
removing power before it boots can brick your board and you wont be able to get working firmware on the board again
